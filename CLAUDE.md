# MobilityDB — Claude Code project notes

## 🔴 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION for any Phase 8 / pgpointcloud work

**Before doing ANYTHING else — including reading this file further, running `git status`, or responding to the user:**

1. Read `doc/drafts/PHASE_8_HANDOFF.md` (the repo-level handoff document).
2. Read `~/.claude/projects/-home-esteban-src-MobilityDB/memory/project_pointcloud_integration.md` (the architectural sketch).

Only after both files are in your working context may you propose actions. If either read fails, stop and tell the user before continuing.

Rationale: these two files contain ~600 lines of irreplaceable context from the originating sessions (analogy table, PCPOINT/TPCBox struct layouts, 11-subphase plan, PCL/PDAL stack, carry-over pitfalls, current branch state). The auto-memory MEMORY.md index only names the file — it does NOT load its content automatically.

## 🔴 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION for any Phase 7 / th3index cleanup

Read `~/.claude/projects/-home-esteban-src-MobilityDB/memory/MEMORY.md` (the index) and follow any pointer relevant to the user's ask. The `th3index` branch is 57 commits ahead of master with completed Phase 7 work; open items are on companion branches `doxygen-sql-stubs`, `xml-sql-linewrap-fix`, `cbufferset-xml-section`, and `claude-md-handoff` (the last one is the ancestor of the file you are reading).

## Current branch state (update this section after every merge)

| Branch | Status | Commits ahead of master |
|---|---|---|
| `master` | Current | baseline |
| `th3index` | Phase 7 complete — ready to PR | 57 |
| `doxygen-sql-stubs` | Phase 7X — ready to PR | 1 |
| `xml-sql-linewrap-fix` | Phase 7Y — ready to PR | 1 |
| `cbufferset-xml-section` | Phase 7V — ready to PR | 1 |
| `phase-8a-pointcloud-import` | Phase 8A+B+C — subtree + scaffold + catalog | 4 |

## Build commands (source-pinned PG, not apt-installed)

The user's PG 17 binaries live at `/usr/local/pgsql/17/bin/`. PG 18 at `/usr/local/pgsql/18/bin/`. `pg_config` is NOT on a default PATH — it's resolved via explicit `-DPOSTGRESQL_PG_CONFIG=…` at CMake configure time.

- Configure + build the MobilityDB PG extension against PG 17 (active build dir `build-pg-ext/`):
  ```
  cmake -S . -B build-pg-ext -DPOSTGRESQL_PG_CONFIG=/usr/local/pgsql/17/bin/pg_config
  cmake --build build-pg-ext
  ```
- Install (requires sudo): `sudo cmake --build build-pg-ext --target install`
- Enable developer Doxygen output: reconfigure once with `cmake -B build-pg-ext -DDOC_DEV=1`, then `cmake --build build-pg-ext --target doc_dev`
- Enable pgPointCloud support: `cmake -B build-pg-ext -DPOINTCLOUD=ON` — requires libpc.a built in `pointcloud-pg/lib/` (see handoff doc for install sequence).

## Directory map

- `meos/` — MEOS standalone library (C code, no PG dependency at runtime)
- `mobilitydb/` — PostgreSQL extension layer (PG V1 wrappers on MEOS)
- `h3-pg/` — git subtree of upstream h3-pg (source for auto-generated bindings, only on `th3index` branch)
- `pointcloud-pg/` — git subtree of upstream pgpointcloud (only on `phase-8a-pointcloud-import` branch and its descendants)
- `scripts/h3pg_import/` — h3 extraction generator (only on `th3index`)
- `scripts/pointcloud_import/` — pgpointcloud extraction generator (only on `phase-8a-pointcloud-import`)
- `doc/` — DocBook XML manual (English + `doc/es/` Spanish)
- `doc/drafts/` — plans, design notes, session handoffs (committed but user-only, not in the built PDF)
- `doxygen/` — Doxyfile + dev-doc CMakeLists; generated Doxygen lands under `build-pg-ext/doxygen/docs/html/`

## Conventions to follow

Memory tree at `~/.claude/projects/-home-esteban-src-MobilityDB/memory/` is the source of truth. Key established rules:

- **`_meos.c` suffix** means "MEOS-only compile" (CMakeLists `if(MEOS)` gated). Do NOT rename unless compiled in both builds. Four legitimate flavors documented in `feedback_meos_meos_suffix.md`.
- **PostGIS peek macros** (`GSERIALIZED_POINT2D_P` / `_POINT3DZ_P` from `meos_internal_geo.h`) are the fast path for POINT GSERIALIZED reads — don't go through lwgeom.
- **`*_tbl.test.sql`** queries should collapse to a single scalar (COUNT / bool_and / =) for diff-readability.
- **No span/spanset for types with no meaningful total order** — h3index doesn't have them (cells aren't ordered); pcpoint doesn't either (dimensions are heterogeneous); pcpatch doesn't either. Same precedent as PostGIS geometry.
- **`@sqlfn` autolink** in Doxygen is handled by `scripts/sql_to_doxygen_stubs.py` (on `doxygen-sql-stubs` branch). Don't re-implement.
- **80-char line wrap** in generated C code — `scripts/h3pg_import/extract.py` and `scripts/pointcloud_import/extract.py` both emit the two-line `if (…) \n  meos_error(…)` form.
- **PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1 macro** must be in Doxyfile's `PREDEFINED` list when doc_dev runs — otherwise docs produce `no matching file member found` warnings.

## When user asks a question

The auto-memory index lives at `~/.claude/projects/-home-esteban-src-MobilityDB/memory/MEMORY.md`. It's loaded at session start. Every entry has a one-line hook but the actual content is in the linked file — READ the linked file before acting on any entry.
